# Book Manager With Auth

In this project we will be creating a book list application using the front end created for you here. Your job is to make the functionality work as follows:

- Make sure the book application is only available to logged in users.
- Display all books on index.html.
- When the form in the add book modal is filled out and submitted, add the book and display the updated books on the index page.
- Show an edit form for a specific book when the edit button is clicked. The template for this is edit.html.
- **Bonus:** Implement a delete button on the edit page.
